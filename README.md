## Known Bug 🚨 Autofill Glitch in Resume Builder!  

### What's Happening? 🤔  
If you're using the **Browser's (e.g., Chrome, Edge, etc.) Autofill** feature to quickly fill out your **Name**, **Email**, and **Phone** details in our **Smart AI Resume Analyzer**, you might encounter this error in generating Resume:  
**"⚠️ Please enter your email address."**  

Even though the email field appears to be filled, this is a small bug in the **Resume Builder Feature** where our system doesn't always recognize inputs from autofill.

### Quick Fix 🛠️  
Don't worry—it's a simple fix!  
1. **Edit the email(or Any) field manually:**  
   - Remove one character or number.  
   - Type it back in.  
2. Voilà! The error will disappear, and you can generate your resume smoothly.  
> _(“Voilà” means "there you have it!" or "problem solved!")_

### Why Does This Happen? 🌐  
This is a **known issue with the resume builder feature**, where the autofill behavior of browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, etc.) doesn't trigger the necessary validation for some input fields. By manually editing the email, the system recognizes it correctly.  

We're actively working on a permanent fix to ensure your experience is seamless. Thank you for your understanding and support! 🙏
